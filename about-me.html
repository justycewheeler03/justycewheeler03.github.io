	<p> My name is Justyce . I've grown up in San Jose California and I enjoy it a lot. I feel like the city is a nice place to be, especially San Jose since it's not too busy.</p>

<p> Along with living in the city I like hanging out with my friends and listening to music. Finding new music and intruducing people to new music is a hobby I have. I have a wide variety when it comes to taste in music and it's pretty cool. Trying new things is nice too especially when it comes to food. I looooooveee food; actually I love all types of food  :) Getting my nails done is a neccesity for me. It's one of my favorite things to do on my own time.</p>
